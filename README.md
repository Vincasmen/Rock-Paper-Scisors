# Rock-Paper-Scissors

This is my first solo project.
Simple Rock 🪨 Paper 📰 Scissors ✂️ game, using basic Java Script.

My main focus was to code as much as possible without any tutorials and outside sources.

The computer creates random choices of rock, paper, and scissors thanks to a random function that goes over the array of choices.

For the main logic of the game, I used "if/else" conditional statements.

With a loop over buttons for the player, the player can click the button, the function will read it, compare it to a random pick from the computer and output the winner of a round.

The point count is set so 5 after that choosing button for the player will disappear, the winner is announced a "Play again" button appears.

The info icon for the modal message is in the upper right corner.
